A running list of example translation gaps. A translation gap is the time period between learning something useful and actually doing that something. 

**Washing Hands**: Dr Semmelweis discovered the usefulness of doctors washing hands in 1847, published the findings in 1861, and the practice was not intellectually accepted until the 1880’s with Dr Pasteur’s research. To this day doctors and nurses do not wash their hands enough (supposedly, depending on whether you ask a doctor, a nurse, or an academic). It is an example of an [opaque heuristic](/opaque-heuristics.html), and a baconian [antiexample](/antiexamples-of-the-baconian-linear-model.html).
