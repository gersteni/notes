An epiphenomenon is when a thing happening is strongly correlated with another thing happening but doesn't cause it.

Because of [causal opacity](/causal-opacity.html), it is hard to distinguish genuine causes from mere correlations — which means many things we treat as causes are probably just epiphenomena.
