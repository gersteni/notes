**[MECE](/mece.html)** - a way of creating lists in a logical way. The king of frameworks.

**Barbell** - maximum paranoia, maximum optionality, nothing in the middle.

**CIA** - a MECE for infosec: confidentiality, integrity, security.

**Controls** - Preventive and Detective. One way to mitigate risk is to put in controls. (April 2024)

**Describing** - can use *[via positiva](/via-positiva.html)* / *[via negativa](/via-negativa.html)* (what it is, what it is not), or [MECE](/mece.html). (April 2024)

**DIGS** - a format to answer interview questions, dramatize/indicate alternatives/go through what you did, summarize.

**Iron Triangle** - for project management: time, budget, scope. 

**Lead, follow, or get out of the way** - a way to think about critics.

**Projects** - Initiation, Planning, Execution, Delivery, Post Delivery. (people always forget the last one, it is the most important). (April 2024)

**Retros** - what happened, what went right, what went wrong, why, how to get better, operationalize (the last is my own addition, try to close the translation gap). (April 2024)

**RICE** - a (bad) way to prioritize things, standing for reach, impact, confidence, effort.

**Risk Mitigation** - avoid (my favorite), transfer (e.g. via insurance or contract), accept, or use controls (April 2024)

**Seven Habits** - from a book, be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win win, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, synergies, sharpen the saw.

**Stakeholders** - shareholder, employees, customers.

**The Triad** - a way of classifying things or systems: fragile, robust, antifragile.
