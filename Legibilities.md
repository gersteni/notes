Here's a running list of [legibility](/legibility.html) examples as I find them or come up with them. 

**State understanding of people** Each person must have a single first name, last name, birthdate, address.
**State understanding of land** Each piece of land has to be owned (and thus held accountable by) a single person. 
**Financial Success** Your financial success is measured by whether you own a house or not, and if you do own a house, how nice it is and what type of neighborhood it is.
**Academia** will not comprehend a discovery unless it is in a peer reviewed journal.
**School** will not comprehend your level of skill unless it is reflected in test scores and assignments.
