If you cannot [describe the past](/fractal-history.html) because of [causal opacity](/causal-opacity.html), it seems obvious that you cannot also predict either. A running list of examples:

**Trump 2016:** Nobody thought Trump would win in 2016 (including, it seems, Trump) (but everyone had a pat explanation later about how it was inevitable).

**Picking Stocks:** It is generally well understood that you cannot predict the performance of the stock market. Interestingly, not only does it seem impossible to predict the winners, but you cannot predict the losers either (otherwise you could short them).

**People:** You cannot predict how someone will turn out. Two children, born to the same parents, basically the same situation, turn out completely different.
